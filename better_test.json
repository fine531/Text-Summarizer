  "text": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns. The primary cause of recent climate change is human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. These gases trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming. The effects include rising sea levels, melting ice caps, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. Scientists agree that immediate action is needed to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have roles to play in addressing this global challenge. Solutions include investing in clean energy, improving energy efficiency, protecting forests, and developing carbon capture technologies."
