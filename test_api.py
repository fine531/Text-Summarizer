    FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ 
    based on standard Python type hints. The key features are: Fast: Very high performance, on par 
    with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop 
    features by about 200% to 300%. Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. 
    Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging. Easy: Designed to be 
    easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs. Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features 
    from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs. Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic 
    interactive documentation.
